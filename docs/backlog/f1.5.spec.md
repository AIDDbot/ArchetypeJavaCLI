# F1.5 Exit codes and process lifecycle Specification

Standardize process exit codes and error messaging for the CLI. Provide a predictable mapping from application outcomes and exceptions to exit codes, ensuring automation (CI) and scripts can reliably detect success and failure. Keep messages concise and user-friendly.

- **Epic**: E1 CLI Scaffold and Runtime
- **Priority**: ‼️ Critical
- **Product Requirements**:
  - R1 CLI scaffold and runtime
  - R7 Non-functional requirements (reliability, clear exit codes)

## User Story 1

- **As a** CLI user running commands locally or in CI
- **I want to** receive 0 on success and a non-zero standardized exit code on failure
- **So that** scripts and pipelines can reliably detect failures

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The CLI SHALL exit with code 0 WHEN the executed command completes successfully.
- [ ] The CLI SHALL exit with code 2 WHEN a validation error occurs (e.g., invalid arguments).
- [ ] The CLI SHALL exit with code 5 WHEN a network connectivity/timeout error occurs.
- [ ] The CLI SHALL exit with code 4 WHEN an I/O error occurs.
- [ ] The CLI SHALL exit with code 1 WHEN an unknown/unhandled error occurs.
- [ ] WHILE running in interactive Shell, exit codes apply to process termination, not individual command invocations.

## User Story 2

- **As a** developer
- **I want to** map exceptions to standardized exit codes
- **So that** failures are predictable and consistent across features

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] An `ExitCodes` enum SHALL define canonical codes (SUCCESS=0, VALIDATION=2, RUNTIME=3, IO=4, NETWORK=5, UNKNOWN=1).
- [ ] An `ExitCodeExceptionMapper` SHALL map common exceptions (`IllegalArgumentException` → 2, `IOException` → 4, socket/timeout/connectivity → 5, others → 1).
- [ ] A `CodedException` type SHALL allow features to signal specific exit codes.

## User Story 3

- **As a** CLI user
- **I want to** read clear and concise error messages
- **So that** I understand what went wrong and how to proceed

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] WHEN a mapped exception occurs, THEN a concise message is printed and the exit code is set accordingly.
- [ ] Error details SHALL be logged at ERROR with the associated exit code for troubleshooting.
