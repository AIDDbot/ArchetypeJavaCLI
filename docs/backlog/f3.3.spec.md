# F3.3 Compose human‑readable weather report

## Context

- Epic: E3 Weather Command
- Depends on: F3.1 Resolve location via IP, F3.2 Fetch current weather from Open‑Meteo

## User stories

1. As a user, when I run `weather` the CLI SHALL print a concise, human‑readable summary containing location and current conditions.

## Acceptance criteria (EARS)

- SHALL: The CLI SHALL render a one‑line summary with location (city/country when available) and key facts (temperature, wind speed, brief description) to stdout.
  - WHEN the weather data is available
  - IF location and observation are present
  - THEN the CLI SHALL print a short summary and exit with code 0

- SHALL: When upstream services fail, the CLI SHALL print a short error message and exit with a non‑zero code.
  - WHEN ip-geo or open-meteo fail
  - IF an error occurs
  - THEN the CLI SHALL print an error and exit with a NETWORK or UNKNOWN code depending on the error

## Notes

- Implement a `WeatherPresenter` to convert domain objects into a short String.
- Add a `WeatherCommands` Shell component that coordinates IpGeoClient and OpenMeteoClient and uses the presenter.
