# F3.4 Design â€” Graceful errors and exit codes

## Goal

Ensure the weather command and integration clients surface clear messages and rely on the existing exit code mapping.

## Approach

- Use `CodedException` from clients to indicate specific exit codes (NETWORK, UNKNOWN).
- Ensure `WeatherCommands` catches unexpected exceptions and wraps them where appropriate, or allows them to propagate to the `DefaultExitCodeExceptionMapper` at process boundary.
- Add small utility `UserFacingErrors` to centralize message formatting (optional).
