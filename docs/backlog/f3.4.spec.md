# F3.4 Graceful errors and exit codes

## Context

- Epic: E3 Weather Command
- Depends on: F1.5 Exit codes and process lifecycle, F2.1 Reactive HTTP client with timeouts

## User stories

1. As a user, when a network error or upstream failure occurs, the CLI SHALL present a concise error message and exit with a documented nonâ€‘zero exit code.

## Acceptance criteria (EARS)

- SHALL: The CLI SHALL surface upstream/network failures as readable error messages.
  - WHEN a network timeout or HTTP error happens
  - IF a client call fails
  - THEN the CLI SHALL print a short error and ensure the process exits with ExitCodes.NETWORK (5)

- SHALL: If a domain validation or argument error occurs, the CLI SHALL exit with ExitCodes.VALIDATION (2).

## Notes

- Leverage existing `CodedException` and `DefaultExitCodeExceptionMapper` for consistent behavior.
