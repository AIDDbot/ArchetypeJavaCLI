# F1.1 Project bootstrap (Maven + Spring Boot + Spring Shell) Specification

Initialize a Java 21 Maven project with Spring Boot and Spring Shell, providing a runnable entrypoint and basic app metadata as the foundation for subsequent features.

- Epic: E1 CLI Scaffold and Runtime
- Priority: ‼️ Critical
- Product Requirements:
  
- R1 CLI scaffold and runtime
- R7 Non-functional requirements

## User Story 1

- As a developer
- I want to have a ready-to-run Spring Boot + Spring Shell CLI skeleton
- So that I can start implementing CLI commands without boilerplate setup

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The project SHALL build with Maven using Java 21 toolchain on Windows/macOS/Linux.
- [ ] WHEN executing the application via Maven (e.g., run goal), THEN the CLI starts into an interactive Spring Shell prompt without custom commands required.
- [ ] IF the local JDK version is not 21, THEN the Maven toolchain SHALL direct the build to use Java 21 or fail with a clear message.
- [ ] The application SHALL include basic metadata (name and version) available in the runtime configuration and logs.

## User Story 2

- As a maintainer
- I want a minimal, conventional project structure and dependencies
- So that future features (commands, config, logging) can be added consistently

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The project structure SHALL follow standard Maven conventions with a single application module.
- [ ] The runtime dependencies SHALL include Spring Boot and Spring Shell; no database or persistence dependencies.
- [ ] WHEN packaging, THEN a bootable artifact configuration SHALL be feasible in later features without restructuring (Spring Boot plugin can be added later).
