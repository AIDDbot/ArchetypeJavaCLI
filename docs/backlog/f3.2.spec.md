# F3.2 Fetch current weather from Open‑Meteo

## Context

- Epic: E3 Weather Command
- Depends on: F2.1 Reactive HTTP client with timeouts, F2.2 External endpoints configuration

## User stories

1. As a user, when I run `weather` with coordinates (or after resolution via IP), the CLI SHALL fetch current weather for those coordinates using Open‑Meteo and present the observation to downstream components.

## Acceptance criteria (EARS)

- SHALL: The CLI SHALL call the configured Open‑Meteo endpoint with latitude and longitude and request current weather fields.
  - WHEN the `weather` command has coordinates available
  - IF Open‑Meteo returns a successful JSON payload
  - THEN the CLI SHALL parse the response into a WeatherObservation domain object containing at least temperature, wind speed, and weather code.

- SHALL: The CLI SHALL handle HTTP or network errors by surfacing a clear message and a NETWORK exit code.
  - WHEN the Open‑Meteo call times out or returns an error
  - IF the call fails
  - THEN the CLI SHALL print an error and terminate with ExitCodes.NETWORK

## Notes

- Use existing `WebClient` and `CliProperties.Endpoints.openMeteoBaseUrl`.
- Define a minimal `WeatherObservation` DTO matching the subset of fields needed.
