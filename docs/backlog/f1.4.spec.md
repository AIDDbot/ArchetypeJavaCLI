# F1.4 Structured logging baseline — Specification

Status: 📝 PLANNED

## Summary

Provide SLF4J-compatible structured logging with JSON output to stdout and log level control via environment variables, suitable for CLI usage and CI/CD pipelines.

## User Stories

1) As an operator, I want the CLI to emit structured logs so that I can parse them in log processors and CI systems.

2) As an operator, I want to control log verbosity via environment variables so that I can adjust noise levels without code changes.

3) As a developer, I want logs to include application metadata (name and version) so that I can correlate events across runs and artifacts.

## Acceptance Criteria (EARS)

- SHALL emit logs in structured JSON format to stdout.
  - WHEN the application starts and throughout execution
  - THEN each log entry includes at least timestamp, level, logger, thread, message, and MDC fields
  - AND includes app metadata fields: app (name) and version

- SHALL allow log level control via environment variables.
  - WHEN the environment variable LOGGING_LEVEL_ROOT is set
  - THEN the root logger uses that level
  - WHERE defaults are INFO if not specified

- SHALL remain SLF4J-compatible with Spring Boot conventions.
  - WHEN libraries or app code log via SLF4J
  - THEN output follows the structured configuration without additional code changes

## Out of Scope

- Persisting logs to files
- Correlation ID injection beyond standard MDC support

## Traceability
