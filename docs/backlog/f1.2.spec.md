# F1.2 Command framework and help system Specification

Expose a help system and command discovery with Spring Shell annotations, including an application banner and a version command so users can discover available commands and version information easily.

- Epic: E1 CLI Scaffold and Runtime
- Priority: ‚ùó High
- Product Requirements: 
  
- R1 CLI scaffold and runtime

## User Story 1

- As a CLI user
- I want to list available commands and their usage
- So that I can understand how to interact with the CLI

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] WHEN the user runs the CLI and types `help`, the system SHALL display a list of available commands with a short description.
- [ ] WHEN the user types `help <command>`, the system SHALL display usage and options for that command.

## User Story 2

- As a CLI user
- I want to see the CLI version and app banner
- So that I can confirm which version I am running

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] WHEN the application starts, the system SHALL display an ASCII banner with the application name.
- [ ] WHEN the user types `version`, the system SHALL print the semantic version from build metadata within 200 ms.

## User Story 3

- As a CLI developer
- I want to add new commands following a consistent pattern
- So that features can be extended predictably

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] WHERE a new command is added, the system SHALL expose it via `@ShellComponent` and `@ShellMethod` with a value/description and clear option names.
- [ ] IF a command is not available due to state, THEN the system SHALL return a clear message via availability checks (scaffold available for future use).
