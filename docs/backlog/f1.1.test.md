# F1.1 Test Notes

This feature is infrastructural (project bootstrap) and not a business feature. No automated tests are required per the test policy. A brief manual smoke check validates the acceptance criteria.

## Scope

- Build uses Java 21 and enforces it via Maven Enforcer/Toolchains when available.
- Application starts in non‑web mode and opens a Spring Shell interactive prompt.
- Basic metadata is available: `spring.application.name` and version logged on startup.

## Manual Smoke Steps

1. Ensure JDK 21 is available (or a toolchain is configured).
2. Start the app with the Maven Boot run goal.
3. Observe:
   - Console shows Spring Boot startup and a log line like: `archetype-java-cli v<version> ready`.
   - An interactive Spring Shell prompt appears.
   - Built‑in commands (e.g., `help`) respond; `exit` quits the shell.

## Result

- Status: Passed (manual verification)
- Date: 2025‑08‑27

> No further automated tests are planned for this bootstrap feature. Future command features will include unit and integration tests.
