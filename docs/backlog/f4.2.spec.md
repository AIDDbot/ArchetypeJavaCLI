# F4.2 Runnable JAR packaging — Specification

Package the CLI as an executable JAR using Spring Boot plugin, embedding dependencies and exposing the main class.

- **Epic**: E4 Build and Packaging
- **Priority**: ❕ Normal
- **Product Requirements**:
  
- R1 CLI scaffold and runtime
- R7 Non-functional requirements

## User Story 1

- **As a** user
- **I want to** download and run a single JAR
- **So that** I can execute the CLI without installing dependencies

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The build SHALL produce a bootable fat JAR via `spring-boot-maven-plugin` using `repackage` goal.
- [ ] WHEN executing `java -jar archetype-java-cli-<ver>.jar`, THEN the Spring Shell CLI SHALL start and show the banner.
- [ ] The artifact name and classifier SHALL be conventional; no custom launcher scripts are required in this feature.

## User Story 2

- **As a** maintainer
- **I want to** include build info
- **So that** the version and git metadata are available at runtime

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The build SHALL generate build info properties via the plugin `build-info` goal.
