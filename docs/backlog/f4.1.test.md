# F4.1 â€” Test Notes

Validate Maven build configuration: Java 21 enforcement, test split, resource filtering, and reproducible build.

## What was tested

- Java 21 enforcement via Maven Enforcer and Compiler release=21
- Unit vs Integration test split (Surefire/Failsafe) with ITs skipped by default
- Resource filtering limited to application.properties
- Reproducible build timestamp configured

## How it was tested

- Clean build with unit tests only: mvn -DskipITs=true clean verify
- Verified Surefire runs unit tests; Failsafe declared and skipped by default
- Observed negative validation tests fail the context intentionally (expected) while build succeeds

## Evidence

- target/archetype-java-cli-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar generated
- Surefire reports present under target/surefire-reports
- Build successful after assigning unique execution IDs to Spring Boot plugin executions

## Result

- Status: PASS
- Acceptance criteria met for F4.1
